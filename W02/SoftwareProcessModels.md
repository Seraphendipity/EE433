## Instructions
> Investigate and compare/contrast several known/adopted software process models.  Use the spreadsheet provided as a way to document your discoveries.

## Discussion
As you stated in class, these models are moreover the ends and extremes of a spectrum which most models fall into. This is perhaps best illustrated with RUP, which combines a bit of the three general processes -- waterfall, incremental, and re-use oriented. It seems moreover, though, that most applications benefit from an incremental-esque development method, with potentiall re-usable classes/assets generated, rather than one large development process. Videogames and small-time programs/sites have tended to gear to this in the past years, it seems, for the simple fact that it can test out ideas and markets before committing a huge investment, with the emphasis on core features and such being a bonus and a nice internal check on developers like me who get lost in additional possibilities.

However, sometimes it just needs to "simply work", and you can't really beat the interconnectedness, reliability, and power of a fully implemented idea and program. Sure, there may be some need to run market tests or such to make sure your multi-million dollar project won't go to waste, but it's dificult to convince an accounting term to accept your new workbook software when half of the features are "coming soon!" It's also absolutely crucial to use a process such as the Clean Room method, with double-checks on your dependencies (if you even use out of house dependencies) and the ruggedness of the software, in cases such as military programming. If the machine gun turns around and kills 73 marines, a patchnote the next morning won't cover the irreperable human loss and suffering. As such, there are cases, it seems, that there is no substitute for the tried and true end-to-end system.
