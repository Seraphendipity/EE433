## [Instructions][instructions]

<blockquote>
Please establish the following public facing:
1.	Github account
2.	Wix account 

Note: in this capacity you will be projecting the academic experience at UAB.  You will need to consider this when choosing an account name.  These accounts will hopefully also be used in establishing your professional career.

In addition, 
1.	Establish a landing page on your Wix page that identifies who you are (to the degree that you are comfortable professionally), includes your interests (once again, stay professional) as well as any previous software experience.
2.	Establish a place holder for your first blog post.  The content of the first blog will be given later, for now “Coming soon” is adequate.  It should link off of your landing page.
3.	Establish basic information on your Github page with a “Sample Project” of your choice, perhaps something you worked on in the past that you are particularly proud of.  If you do not have any idea/content, feel free to ask me for assistance.
4.	Establish a link to your Github page on your Wix landing page.

Deliverables:
1.	Using the Submission Template I provided, include the urls to both the Wix and Github landing pages.  Name the file “Assignment #2.docx”
2.	Include in your deliverable, any comments/observations/difficulties you may have had – I value this feedback.

## GitHub Project Page: https://github.com/Seraphendipity/CocoaRose 
[![Seraphendipity's GitHub Page][GHLogo]][GHMain]

I chose this project as it is perhaps my largest and more complex. It still has a ways to go, but is fairly decent. Regarding the version control, I need to do some rebasing to merge some series of commits together (namely the WIP BROKEN ones).

Feel free to browse my other projects. I plan to fix some of them up in the future as some of them are messy (due to learning Git), but are OK for some filler portfolio student stuff. Also [this entire course is uploaded as well][GHEE433], so if you want to get meta...

## Wix Page: https://elijahtrose.wixsite.com/portfolio
[![Elijah T.he Rose's Wix Page][WixLogo]][WixMain]

A rudimentary site. The above CocoaRose page is my attempt at learning web development -- ideally, I do not want to rely on a CMS such as Wix or WP for my portfolio, it's akin to a page designer using a standard page template for their portfolio. I'm also somewhat irritated with Wix personally, as even the simple and much uglier CococaRose site is 100+ hours of learning and web development, only to be completely showed up by a 5-minute set-up process. It's sort of on the same grounds why I have an inherent distaste for Python -- you don't know the pain, the sweat, the love to make a simple array sorting algorithm in Assembly or C, when you can simply go `sort(this)`. Perhaps its pride, or elitism, but oh well.
